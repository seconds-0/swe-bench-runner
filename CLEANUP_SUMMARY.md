# API Key Cleanup Summary

## Problem
- API keys were accidentally committed in documentation
- GitHub push protection blocked the push
- Keys appeared in commits `4a8c67b` and `9c28380`

## Solution
1. Created clean branch from before problematic commits
2. Cherry-picked only the fixes that use placeholders
3. Verified no API keys remain in codebase
4. Successfully pushed clean branch

## Result
✅ PR created: https://github.com/seconds-0/swe-bench-runner/pull/11
✅ Clean commit history without sensitive data
✅ All functionality preserved
✅ API keys remain secure in GitHub Secrets

## Lessons Learned
- Always use placeholders in documentation examples
- Never commit actual API keys, even for testing
- GitHub push protection is valuable for catching mistakes

## Next Steps
- The PR can be reviewed and merged
- Integration tests will run with securely stored keys
- No sensitive data exposed in repository history
