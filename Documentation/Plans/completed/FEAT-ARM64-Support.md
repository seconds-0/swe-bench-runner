# ARM64/Apple Silicon Support Implementation

**Status**: âœ… Completed
**Date**: 2025-08-14
**Author**: Engineering Team

## Problem Statement
SWE-bench doesn't provide pre-built Docker images for ARM64 architecture (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3), preventing Mac users from running evaluations.

## Solution Implemented
Automatic detection of ARM64 architecture with local Docker image building using the SWE-bench harness.

## Key Features Delivered
1. **Automatic Architecture Detection**
   - Platform detection using `platform.machine()`
   - Conditional logic for ARM64 vs x86_64

2. **Local Docker Building**
   - Empty namespace triggers local builds
   - `--namespace none` flag for harness
   - Automatic configuration persistence

3. **Real-time Progress Tracking**
   - Live output streaming during builds
   - Build phase detection (Base, Environment, Repository, etc.)
   - Spinner with elapsed time display
   - Graceful fallback for non-Rich environments

4. **TUI Integration**
   - Clear ARM64 detection message
   - Build time warnings (30-60+ minutes)
   - Skip GHCR authentication for local builds
   - Fixed wizard flow to prevent early exits

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/swebench_runner/docker_run.py`: Core ARM64 detection and build logic
- `src/swebench_runner/tui.py`: TUI flow and ARM64 messaging
- `src/swebench_runner/cli.py`: Architecture-aware command handling

### Key Functions
- `detect_platform()`: Returns architecture string
- `_invoke_with_progress()`: Real-time build progress tracking
- `_persist_namespace()`: Saves configuration to .env
- `preflight_wizard()`: Updated flow for ARM64

## Testing
- Manual testing on Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2)
- Verified local Docker builds complete successfully
- Confirmed cached images are reused
- Tested TUI flow end-to-end

## Performance Metrics
- First build: 30-60+ minutes per repository
- Subsequent runs: Instant (cached)
- Memory usage: 8-16GB during build
- Disk space: ~120GB for full image set

## Lessons Learned
1. Rich markup requires careful tag matching
2. TUI flow control needs explicit continuation (no early returns)
3. Progress tracking essential for long operations
4. Architecture detection should be fail-safe

## Future Improvements
- Pre-built ARM64 image distribution
- Parallel build optimization
- Build cache sharing between users
- Progress estimation based on historical data
