**Last Updated**: 2025-01-30 (Verified and Updated)
**Current Branch**: pr-11-rebase
**Latest Commit**: (Check git log for latest)
**Status**: Core functionality complete, needs documentation and test coverage

## 🎯 Project Status Summary

The SWE-bench Runner project is **functionally complete**. All core features are implemented and working. Remaining work is documentation and test coverage.

**See `Documentation/Plans/PLAN-VERIFICATION-SUMMARY.md` for detailed verification of all plans.**

### ✅ What's Done (Verified)
1. **Core MVP Features** - ALL COMPLETE
   - Basic CLI with `swebench` command
   - Docker-based evaluation using SWE-bench harness
   - Basic output formatting (terminal + JSON)
   - Dataset auto-fetch from HuggingFace
   
2. **Model Provider System** - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
   - OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter providers
   - Unified abstraction layer with all components
   - CLI integration (`--provider` flag) 
   - Provider management commands (list, init, test, models)
   - Advanced features (circuit breaker, rate limiting, streaming)
   
3. **Infrastructure** - COMPLETE
   - Thread-safe provider registry
   - Authentication strategies (Bearer, API Key, None)
   - Request/response transformation pipeline
   - Token counting unification
   - Streaming adapters (SSE, JSON Lines)
   - Rate limiting coordination

4. **Integration Tests** - FIXED
   - All providers have correct API usage
   - Comprehensive test coverage added
   - Error scenarios and edge cases covered

### 🔴 What Needs Work
1. **Test Coverage** - 58% (needs 60%+ for CI)
   - Add unit tests for abstraction layer components
   - Increase coverage to meet threshold

2. **Documentation** - MINIMAL
   - ✅ Provider setup guides complete
   - ✅ Getting started guide exists
   - ❌ No API reference documentation
   - ❌ No code examples directory
   - ❌ CLI reference needs expansion
   - ❌ No troubleshooting guide

3. **Examples** - NONE
   - Need basic usage examples
   - Provider comparison examples
   - Batch processing examples

## 🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Test Coverage** (1-2 days)
   - Add unit tests for abstraction layer components
   - Get to 60%+ coverage (currently 58%)
   - Focus on provider wrappers and utilities
   
2. **Documentation** (2-3 days)
   - Generate API reference from docstrings
   - Create examples/ directory with usage examples
   - Expand CLI reference with all commands
   - Write troubleshooting guide
   
3. **Polish & Launch** (1-2 days)
   - PyPI packaging setup
   - Create changelog from git history
   - Write release notes for v1.0
   - Final testing on fresh environment

## 📊 Quick Metrics

- **Core Features**: 100% ✅
- **Providers Implemented**: 4/4 ✅
- **Integration Tests**: Fixed ✅
- **Test Coverage**: 58% ⚠️ (need 60%)
- **Documentation**: ~20% 🔴
- **Examples**: 0% 🔴
- **CI Status**: All passing (except coverage)
- **Time to v1.0**: 4-7 days

## 🔗 Important Files

- Main CLI: `src/swebench_runner/cli.py`
- Providers: `src/swebench_runner/providers/`
- Provider CLI: `src/swebench_runner/cli_provider.py`
- Integration Tests: `tests/integration/test_*_integration.py`

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Implementation is Complete** - All planned features are implemented and working
2. **Planning Documents Were Outdated** - Many "incomplete" plans were actually finished
3. **Quality Over Theatre** - Focus on real gaps (docs, tests) not creating more plans
4. **Launch Ready** - With 4-7 days on docs and tests, v1.0 can ship

## 📋 Verification Notes

- All core MVP plans (CLI, Docker, Output, Dataset) verified as complete
- Provider system fully implemented with 4 providers
- Integration tests fixed and comprehensive
- Remaining work is polish, not features
