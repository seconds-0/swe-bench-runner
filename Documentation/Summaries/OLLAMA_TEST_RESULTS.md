# Ollama Integration Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-07-27

## Environment Setup

### Ollama Installation Status
- **Was Ollama already running?**: No
- **Installation method**: Homebrew (`brew install ollama`)
- **Version installed**: 0.9.6

### Setup Steps Taken
1. Checked if Ollama was running: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags` - Failed (not running)
2. Checked if Ollama was installed: `which ollama` - Not found
3. Installed via Homebrew: `brew install ollama` - Success
4. Started Ollama service: `brew services start ollama` - Success
5. Pulled test model: `ollama pull llama3.2:1b` - Success (1.3 GB downloaded)

### Python Environment Issues
- System Python 3.9.6 doesn't support union syntax `float | None` (requires Python 3.10+)
- Installed Python 3.12 via Homebrew
- Created virtual environment with Python 3.12
- Installed project dependencies successfully

## Test Execution Results

### Summary: ALL TESTS FAILED (16/16 failures)

### Root Causes of Failures

1. **Import Error Fixed**: `ProviderModelNotFoundError` doesn't exist in the codebase
   - Fixed by replacing with `ProviderError`

2. **API Mismatch - CRITICAL ISSUE**: The integration tests use completely wrong API
   - Tests use: `UnifiedRequest(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}])`
   - Actual API: `UnifiedRequest(prompt="...", system_message="...")`
   - This indicates the tests were written for a different API design

3. **Fixture Issues**: The `provider` fixture appears to be incorrectly implemented
   - Runtime warnings about coroutine never awaited
   - This suggests async/fixture setup problems

### Actual Test Output
```
TypeError: UnifiedRequest.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'messages'
```

This error appears in EVERY test because they all use the wrong API.

### Test Coverage Impact
The integration tests provide 0% effective coverage because they don't even call the actual API correctly.

## Conclusion

The Ollama integration tests are fundamentally broken and appear to have been written for a different version of the API that used a chat-style messages format instead of the current prompt/system_message format.

### Issues Found:
1. **Non-existent exception imports** - Easy fix (completed)
2. **Wrong API usage throughout all tests** - Requires complete rewrite
3. **Possible fixture implementation issues** - Needs investigation
4. **Tests don't match current codebase design** - Fundamental mismatch

### Recommendation:
These integration tests need to be completely rewritten to match the actual `UnifiedRequest` API. They currently provide no value and cannot validate whether the Ollama provider actually works.

## Ollama Service Status
- Ollama is now running successfully on the system
- Model `llama3.2:1b` is available for testing
- The service itself appears functional based on API responses
