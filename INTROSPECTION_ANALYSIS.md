# SubagentStop Hook Analysis

## Current Implementation Review

### Goal Achievement
- **✅ User Visibility**: Introspection report displays in terminal when subagent completes
- **❌ Agent Feedback**: Primary agent doesn't receive introspection results
- **✅ Automated Checks**: TODOs, git status, and file modifications are checked

### Loop Prevention
**No loop risk** with current implementation because:
1. Checks `stop_hook_active` flag before running
2. Uses exit code 1 (user display only, no Claude feedback)
3. Early exit prevents re-execution

### Limitations

1. **One-Way Communication**
   - Reports go to user, not back to primary agent
   - Can't trigger automated responses based on introspection

2. **Platform Issues**
   - `find` command won't work on Windows
   - Should use Python's pathlib for cross-platform support

3. **Performance**
   - Searches all Python files (could be slow in large repos)
   - No scope limiting or configuration

## Version 2 Improvements

The `subagent_introspection_v2.py` file addresses these issues:

### Key Features
1. **Dual Mode Operation**
   - `INTROSPECTION_MODE=user`: Shows report to user (default)
   - `INTROSPECTION_MODE=agent`: Feeds back to Claude as JSON

2. **Loop Prevention for Agent Mode**
   - Sets `INTROSPECTION_DONE` environment variable
   - Checks this variable to prevent re-triggering
   - Uses "continue" decision to avoid blocking

3. **Cross-Platform**
   - Uses pathlib instead of `find` command
   - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

4. **Structured Feedback**
   - JSON format for agent processing
   - Human-readable format for user display
   - Configurable response actions

## Usage Recommendations

### For User Notification Only (Safe, Current Behavior)
Use the original `subagent_introspection.py` with exit code 1

### For Agent-to-Agent Communication
1. Use `subagent_introspection_v2.py`
2. Set `INTROSPECTION_MODE=agent` in environment
3. The hook will:
   - Add introspection results as context to Claude
   - Allow Claude to continue normally
   - Prevent loops via environment variable

### Hook Configuration Options

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/subagent_introspection.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Or for agent feedback mode:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "INTROSPECTION_MODE=agent python3 ~/.claude/hooks/subagent_introspection_v2.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The current implementation is **safe and achieves partial goals**:
- ✅ No loop risk
- ✅ User sees introspection reports
- ❌ No automated agent response to issues

To enable full automation with agent-to-agent feedback, use v2 with agent mode, which includes proper loop prevention.
