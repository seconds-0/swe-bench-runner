> Run any subset of SWE-bench with one clear command and fix any issue in minutes, not hours.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Status**: MVP CLI implemented. Docker execution coming next.

## Vision

SWE-bench has become the de-facto benchmark for evaluating code-fixing agents, but getting the harness to run locally is still painful. This tool makes SWE-bench evaluation so simple that users think "Holy shit, this is what I wanted the whole time!"

## Current Status

**‚úÖ MVP CLI Complete** - Basic command-line interface is ready:

```bash
pip install swebench-runner
swebench run --patches my_patches.jsonl
```

The CLI currently validates patches files and provides foundation for Docker execution (coming next).

## Installation

```bash
pip install swebench-runner
```

## Usage

```bash
# Check version
swebench --version

# Get help
swebench --help
swebench run --help

# Run evaluation (MVP - validation only)
swebench run --patches predictions.jsonl
```

## Current Features

- ‚úÖ Click-based CLI with `swebench` command
- ‚úÖ `run` command with `--patches` flag
- ‚úÖ File validation (exists, not empty, is file)
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and exit codes
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (96% coverage)
- ‚úÖ Type checking with mypy
- ‚úÖ Linting with ruff
- ‚úÖ <5KB wheel size

## Coming Next

- üöß Docker execution (MVP-DockerRun)
- üöß Basic output formatting (MVP-BasicOutput)
- üöß Progress tracking and HTML reports

## Development

This project is being developed with AI assistance following the workplan methodology outlined in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install development environment
make install        # Install package + dev dependencies
make hooks         # Install pre-commit hooks

# During development
make check         # Run quick CI checks
make test          # Run full test suite
make lint          # Auto-fix linting issues
make mypy          # Run type checking

# Before opening a PR
make pre-pr        # Run FULL CI simulation
make ci-full       # Alias for pre-pr

# Cleanup
make clean         # Remove build artifacts and caches
```
