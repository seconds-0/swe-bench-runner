   - CLI integration (`--provider` flag)
   - Provider management commands (list, init, test, models)
   - Advanced features (circuit breaker, rate limiting, streaming)

3. **Infrastructure** - COMPLETE
   - Thread-safe provider registry
   - Authentication strategies (Bearer, API Key, None)
   - Request/response transformation pipeline
   - Token counting unification
   - Streaming adapters (SSE, JSON Lines)
   - Rate limiting coordination

4. **Integration Tests** - FIXED
   - All providers have correct API usage
   - Comprehensive test coverage added
   - Error scenarios and edge cases covered

5. **E2E Test Infrastructure** - COMPLETE (Phase 2.1)
   - Test doubles replace 97% of environment mocks
   - Module-level testing with dependency injection
   - ~20% performance improvement
   - Clean, maintainable test infrastructure

6. **CLI/TUI Reliability** - COMPLETE (2025-08-18)
   - Smart menu defaults based on user configuration
   - Direct function calls eliminate subprocess architecture issues
   - Consistent Docker checking patterns
   - Enhanced user experience and reliability

### üî¥ What Needs Work
1. **Test Coverage** - Currently 58% (needs 60%+ for CI)
   - Need just 2% more coverage to meet minimum threshold
   - Focus on covering uncovered functions and edge cases
   - Priority for v1.0 release readiness

2. **PyPI Packaging** - NOT STARTED
   - Need to create setup.py/pyproject.toml configuration
   - Test installation in clean environment
   - Release automation

3. **Documentation** - MINIMAL
   - ‚úÖ Provider setup guides complete
   - ‚úÖ Getting started guide exists
   - ‚ùå API reference documentation (defer to v1.1)
   - ‚ùå Code examples directory (defer to v1.1)

4. **Examples** - NONE (defer to v1.1)
   - Basic usage examples
   - Provider comparison examples
   - Batch processing examples
